Task 2: Build a Simple Linear Regression Model
Description

This project involves building a simple linear regression model to predict a continuous variable (for example, house prices). The goal is to understand the process of creating, training, interpreting, and evaluating a linear regression model using Python and popular data science libraries.
Objectives

    Load a dataset and preprocess it:
    The first step is to import a dataset relevant to the prediction task. Preprocessing may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling features to prepare the data for modeling.

    Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn:
    Utilize the LinearRegression class from the scikit-learn library to fit a model to the training data. This involves splitting the data into features (inputs) and the target variable (output), and then training the model to learn the relationship between them.

    Interpret the model coefficients:
    After training, analyze the learned coefficients (weights) of the model. These coefficients indicate how much each feature contributes to the prediction. Understanding them helps in interpreting the importance and influence of each input variable.

    Evaluate the model using R-squared and mean squared error (MSE):
    Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics:

        R-squared (RÂ²): Measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. A value closer to 1 indicates a better fit.

        Mean Squared Error (MSE): Represents the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better accuracy.

    Tools:

        Python: The programming language used for implementation.

        pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

        scikit-learn: For model building, training, and evaluation.
